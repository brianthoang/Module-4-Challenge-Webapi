# Module-4-Challenge-Webapi

Instructions for this challenge were to create a quiz that can record high scores. When the user opens the webpage, they are expected to see a start button with instructions of how the quiz works. When the user initiates the quiz, the timer begins and the user is presented a question. After the user answers the question, another question appears. Any wrong answers will deduct the user's time/score by a certain amount. The quiz is officially over when the user answers all the question or the timer has reached 0. When the quiz is over, the user can record their score with their name.
